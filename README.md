PROBLEM STATEMENT : Artificial intelligence is seen as central to the digital transformation of society and it has become an human need . Evolutions are being made in the field of AI , and nowadays society is moving towards a hands-free environment where the things may work on their speech or their thinking . Certain software have been developed and more enhancements are being made into them .  But till yet there has not been any software for the students on pc for hands-free environment so that they can use it. We will be developing a  software which will operate almost each and every function in a desktop or laptop just on voice command . Basically, a their own AI tool which would be very helpful
